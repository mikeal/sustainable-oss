# Brief History of Open Source

## 1959

MIT's Building 26 was home to the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and,
deep in its basement, the Electronic Accounting Machinery room (EAM room).

TMRC was home to "hackers," individuals who would go to great lengths to
overcome the technical challenges of electronic railroad making. In contrast
The EAM room, staffed only by those with official priviledge, was guarded as if
the machines would die if miss-used.

In the EAM room a select few would punch instructions onto manilla cards and
then send them upstairs to the IBM 704 (The Hulking Giant), a multi-million
dollar computer the size of a modern San Francisco apartment.

But at night, the high-noon of the hacker, the EAM room was left
unguarded. Hackers of the TMRC had no interest in dealing with the process and
pagentry that accompanied bringing cards to the IBM 704 but what they
eventually discovered, tucked away in the EAM room, was a special keypunch
machine called the 407. One hacker, Peter Samson, realized that with a plug
board and a mess of wiring they could turn the 407 into a computer of sorts.

This was the first step in bringing their hacker ethos
the world of computing. These hackers would introduce a set of values to the
computers programming which we now, more than 50 years later,
can see as the life blood of Open Source Sustainability.

## The Rise and Fall of the MIT Hackers

TMRC hackers revelled in wires and power
supplys. They valued the process of getting something to work as much, probably
more, than the end result of any of that work. They shared ideas and
collaborated liberally. They spent late nights with each other talking and
tinkering. TMRC was a paradise for a particular kind of person and just the fact
that so many had found each other was something special.

When the TMRC hackers turned their attention to another machine in
Building 26, the TX-0, which used paper tape instead of punch cards, everything
changed.
Spools of tape would come to contain utilities and routines that everyone
was free to use and improved upon, shaving off operations
and inventing new optimizations.

The hacker ethos thrived around the TX-0 and started to resemble a way of
life for some. Access to computers and the tools of learning should be
unlimited and total. Barriers to learning, collaborating, and contributing
were harshly criticised.

Timeshare systems that limited your freedom to use computers
were hacked or discarded so that people could use, learn, and develop more
freely. The TX-0 would give way to newer computers and hackers came to dominate
a growing field within MIT, Artificial Intelligence.

In 1963 Project Mac coalesced most MIT hackers into the "AI Group"
which would continue to grow and lead to the formation of the MIT AI Lab in
1970. During this time many hackers, and their ethos, first began to disperse
from MIT with many landing out west at Stanford and across the Bay Area.

In the 1970s the MIT AI Lab would start to produce Lisp machines. These were
general purpose computers designed for running Lisp, the primary language in
the field of AI. By the early 1980s two companies had spun off of the lab to
commercialize Lisp machines (Symbolics and Lisp Machines, Inc). This
drained hackers from MIT into private enterprise. By the early 1980s none were
left.

Well, not *all* of them left. One remained.

## Richard Stallman

By 1983 Richard Stallman (RMS) was
["The Last of the True Hackers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution#Epilogue:_The_Last_of_the_True_Hackers)
at the MIT AI Lab. Stallman came to the lab as a programmer in 1971 while he
finished his Physics degree at Harvard. Stallman found his true home in hacker
culture and became its standard-bearer.

Stallman's views began to change after seeing what happened to his beloved AI
Lab. "Tourists" would come to the lab because of their liberal usage policies
but didn't stick around the improve upon what made the lab great. With the
other hackers lured away and no way to keep any new ones there his hacker
paradise would wither and die.

Richard initially focused on taking revenge for the death of the AI Lab.
Symbolics was the more commercialized LISP company
as Lisp Machines Inc (LMI) tried to organize itself on hacker principals.
Symbolics was also more aggressive about hiring away hackers from the AI Lab.

The initial LISP Operating System was shared by MIT, LMI, and Symbolics but Symbolics eventually took its work proprietary in order to try and gain a competitive advantage over LMI.

RMS vowed never to use a Symbolics LISP machine, to never help or collaborate
with any Symbolics developer, and devoted his time to ruining them.

He followed the improvements and bug fixes Symbolics would make and would then
re-engineer the same features and fixes for the code shared by MIT and LMI.
Richard was effectively matching the work of over a dozen skilled Symbolics
engineers. Symbolics was not happy "He calls it reverse engineering. We call it
theft of trade secrets."

For Richard, there seemed to be nothing left to lose.

["I'm the last survivor of a dead culture," said RMS. "And I don't really belong to the world anymore. And in some ways I feel I ought ot be dead."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution#Epilogue:_The_Last_of_the_True_Hackers) [from Hackers by Steve Levy]

 Even with all the work he had done on the Lisp Operating System RMS
 was best known for his editor EMACS. Richard shared EMACS with anyone
 who agreed to contribute back any improvements they made which he called "the
 EMACS commune."

 When RMS finally left the AI Lab he did so with the intention
 of building a new operating system under the principles of the hacker ethos.
 His first tasks were not the kernel but the utitilities on top of a kernel
 users needed most. As he published these utilities (emacs, gcc, gdb) he would
 write public licenses for each that attempted codify the "EMACS commune" and
 persist hacker values like sharing and open collaboration. These would be
 standardized and improved upon as the GNU Public License (GPL) which
 would come to be used by not just Richard's code but thousands of developer's
 around the world.

As more developers adopted this license they also adopted the principals and
values Richard sought to persist. The "last hacker" had planted seeds in
fertile ground that grew into a thriving community.

## Tim O'Reilly

Tim started as a technical writer in 1977 a few years after getting his BA from
Harvard. By 1983 he had setup a small business in a converted barn in Newton
Massachussets publishing technical manuals for UNIX systems. These were the
manuals you received when you purchased a proprietary computer and operation
system in the early 80s.

O'Reilly negotiated with the companies contracting these manuals to retain the
publishing rights, allowing him to sell the manuals independently from the
purchase of any hardware or software. O'Reilly Media also produced several
"Nutshell Handbooks" which were condensed and simpler versions of the more
thorough manuals.

"Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" was published in 1992 by O'Reilly
media. This was a guide to the new but growing "Internet." The book was modeled
after the influential counterculture magazine "Whole Earth Catalog"
that proved formative for a generation of hippies, activists, and an
impressionable Steve Jobs.

Richard Stallman had taken the final spark of hacker ethos and lit a fire he
called "Free Software," a nod to "Free Speech" and "Free Expresion." The
Internet was gasoline on that fire.

The hacker ethos said that anyone who could enter the room should be free to
access the computer in it and to iterate on its software. As computers entered
the home and the Internet connected those computers the hacker ethos could be
applied across continents.

Sitting in the cross section of proprietary software (UNIX manuals) the
Internet and Free Software was Tim O'Reilly. Very few people could gauge the
demand for Free Software knowledge compared to demand of proprietary systems
and even fewer truly understood the potential the Internet could bring.

Tim is as calm and relaxed as they come. His gentle demeanor and thirst for
knowledge makes him easily at home with geeks and hackers. His comfort and
status as a member of their community often distracts from the dramatic
difference in perspective Tim brought to the Free Software world.

Not only could Tim see that people wanted to know more about Free Software,
Tim knew first hand the comparative *quality* of Free Software. Who would think
that the software of expensive UNIX systems is worse, in many cases **much**
worse, than completely free alternatives?

By the mid-90's Free Software had gained a lot of attention. As individuals and
companies tried to create business models around it the term "Free Software"
grew more problematic. This lead some firms to create their own divergent terms
which only increased the confusion.

The announcement in 1998 by Netscape that they would be releasing the source
of their browser under the name "Mozilla" brought all of the concerns to
a head. A meeting was held by Tim O'Reilly as well as Linus
Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Paul Vixie, Guido van Rossum, and Eric
S. Raymond. After the meeting they adopted the term "Open Source" in place of
"Free Software." It's important to note that those adopting the term Open
Source were not removing themselves or distancing themselves from the Free
Software community. Participants felt they weren't splitting the community but
simply re-branding it. It wasn't until later that the Free Software community
decided to differentiate themselves as a seperate but related movement.

Through the late nineties and even through the dotcom crash that almost
destroyed his publishing business, Tim O'Reilly remained an avid Open Source
advocate. A big part of that message had been that software created and
maintained by a community was actually superior to most software that you could
buy.

As more companies came to depend on Open Source they also ended up funding a
new generation of contributors. These weren't part time tinkerers, they were
full time paid employees of virtually every major company. Companies weren't
"giving back" to Open Source out of some notion of charity, they were building
businesses that depended on Open Source and were investing appropriately.

But this new influx of corporate investment also
created a new class of challenges for the sustainability of these Open Source
projects.

## The Apache Software Foundation

The Apache HTTPD server was released in 1995. By April 1996 it was the most
popular HTTP server in the world. This was the first big fight Open Source had
against Proprietary Software that it had won. Microsoft tried hard to dominate
this space, as it had dominated most of software, but lost outright.

In June of 1999 the Apache Software Foundation was formed to provide
institutional support for the Apache HTTPD server. The structure of the
foundation was a new experiment in extending the principals of contributor
rights to the administration of a non-profit foundation.

In addition to donations from corporations and individuals the ASF's top
contributors and board members were, for the most part, fully employed by
related companies. While Apache made it clear that individuals represent
themselves, not their employers, this did put Apache in a unique position to
understand the needs of companies dependent on Open Source and to reconcile
those needs into those of the project's contributors.

It wasn't long before other projects started knocking on the ASF's door looking
for a home. As Open Source grew so did the insitutional needs of major
projects. Companies also grew to appreciate Apache's distributed ownership
and governance model over other governance models where an individual or small
group of individuals could be bought out or unduly influenced by a competitor.

As Apache accepted more projects and their contributors grew they became the
epicenter of a new generation of open source contributors. As a result, Apache
was also the center of new challenges in Open Source Sustaibility.

## Barriers to Entry

To go from a regular computer user to a contributor to emacs in 1995 was a
long process. In addition to learning how to program a particular way you'd
need to learn communication tools like USENET, you'd have to learn a variety of
development toolchains and deal with some *challenging* personalities. It
wasn't a matter of just reading some docs on a website, you had to be ready to
invest yourself in this community.

As you worked your way through learning the tools and personalities you'd also
learn the project values, descendent from the hacker ethod. These values were
enshrined (and in fact legally required) by the license. Programmers of this
generation were a pretty cohesive community because they had these shared
values. Those values also brought sustainability to these projects, ensuring
that as the community grew so did the contributors. Without contributing back,
without the expectation and validation of participation, these projects would
never have continued to exist.

As the Apache Software Foundation worked on reducing these barriers to entry,
on making it easier to contribute, and as the business of software became more
dependent on Open Source, they saw a lot of new contributors coming on. Because
many of these contributors were already familiar with developing proprietary
software using open source tools they were able to hit the ground running
without necessarily adopting any of the values the ASF was built on. If the ASF
could not persist those values who would they create a sustainable community?

Apache believes that contributors should control the destiny of the project.
Not the Apache Board, not the Apache Donors, the people who do the work writing
code and fixing bugs. But what would happen if a project was governed by people
who didn't share the values that make Apache, and open source, sustainable?

In response, the ASF built a series of processes contributors learn and live by
in their projects. Those processes effectively embed their values. The result
was that a developer who knew nothing but a corporate heirarchy shipping boxed
software could come out the other end a defender of software freedom.

Today, many of those processes, and the tools they rely on, may seem outdated.
I've been a pretty vocal critic of them myself, but it's hard to overestimate
the impact and influence of Apache in the decade between 2000 and 2010. Not
only were many notable projects at Apache, most of the key thinkers and Open
Source advocates went through Apache as well.

My own beliefs, including my criticism of Apache today, comes from the values
passed through the ASF. Ted Leung, a long time Apache member, taught me these
values in 2006 at the Open Source Applications Foundation. This isn't all that
surprising, if you were at an organization during this time and there was an
"open source person" they were almost surely from Apache.

## The Modern Era

The values that this text seeks to persist: Participation, Transparency, and
Efficacy, are as old as the hacker ethos and can trace their roots to it.

These values were almost lost, and would have been lost, had we not found new
ways to persist them into the next generation of growth in computing.

There's a tendency to think that just because an idea is good it will survive,
that it will win, that this is innevitable. But history teaches us that we need
people and movements for them to win, that our history does not write
itself.

As we examine the modern era of open source, an era once again defined by
unprecedented growth and the removal of barriers to entry, we are faced with
the same problem: how do we persist the values that will allow us to be
sustainable?

Today, the growth and distribution of projects and contributors is far too great
for a single license to be adopted by all participants or for every participant
to work through a unified process that can teach them these values.

Faced with new challenges we will need to do what those have done before, to
find creative ways to persist values that can sustain our work.
